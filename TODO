- = LONG TERM
? = unsure
O = OK, done

// General

* Priorities for the next minor release:
  * Make the widget more robust (font management)

+ make DPI a configurable parameter
? make pangolayout pangolinelayout areas configurable (glyph area?)
? have callback functions to notify progress while building/formatting/etc?
  these should not depend on the backend
- use step area to implement linebreaking in mrows
- add possibility of disabling shaping of certain characters for shapers. Eg:
  <section name="disable-shaping">
    <key name="char">03BB</key>
    <section name="range">
      <key name="from">A0</key>
      <key name="to">B0</key>
    </section>
  </section>

// AbiWord

* commit default shaper in abimathview

// MathML

BUGS

? when index == length in a glyph area the caret is drawn
  at the right end of the focus' bounding box. It would be
  more appropriate to draw it just after the glyph, especially
  for mo elements. Is this really better?
? selecting the root <math> element does not show selection

ARCH IMPROVEMENTS

* MathMLNormalizingContainerElement::format can be removed
? make default value of attributes configurable
? make GlyphStringArea a leaf-like area?
- change the clone method for areas so that it checks if the
  content is unchanged, and possibly implement the replace this
  way
- implement auxiliary methods for searching into the area model
- It may be feasible to generalize searching functions
  over areas by implementing a visitor
O it seems like the choice of having that the first child of a
  vertical area is the bottommost is a bit weird. Think of the cursor:
  intuitively at increasing indices the cursor should go forward (that
  is right or down depending on the container). No, it is consistent
  with the coordinate system used by areas where the origin is at the
  bottom

PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS

- in TemplateBuilder do not use the hash map for retrieving old
  elements, but use accessor methods instead. Much faster 

MISSING

? make setSelected virtual in Gtk_WrapperArea and implement
  an open Wrapper area that selects all its children. Use the
  open wrapper for groups
- runtime selection of backend

// GTK Backend

ARCH IMPROVEMENTS

+ define selection as a pluggable feature (much like decorators)
instead of a built-in feature. For some operations it may be desirable
not to have selection implemented this way
+ same with click
